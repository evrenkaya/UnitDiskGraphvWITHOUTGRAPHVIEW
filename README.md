# Unit Disk Graph Algorithm Utility Kit

This program stores a unit disk graph in memory and allows certain algorithms to be run on it.

I created this program during my research internship with professor Anil Maheshwari to test some key theorems from a previous publication on Unit Disk Graphs that can be found at URL: http://people.scs.carleton.ca/~michiel/UDG-Thresholds.pdf

Please see the "UnitDiskGraphReport" folder on this page for a more detailed documentation of this program.
