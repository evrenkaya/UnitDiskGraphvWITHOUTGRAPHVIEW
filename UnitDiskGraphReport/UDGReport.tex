\section{Introduction}
Wireless networks are usually modeled as disk graphs in the plane. Given a set $P$ of points in the plane and a positive parameter $r$, the {\em disk graph} is the geometric graph with vertex set $P$ which has a straight-line edge between two points $p,q\in P$ if and only if $|pq|\le r$, where $|pq|$ denotes the Euclidean distance between $p$ and $q$. If $r=1$, then the disk graph is referred to as {\em unit disk graph}.  
A {\em random geometric graph}, denoted by $\dg$, is a geometric graph formed by choosing $n$ points independently and uniformly at random in a unit square; two points are connected by a straight-line edge if and only if they are at Euclidean distance at most $r$, where $r=r(n)$ is a function of $n$ and $r \to 0$ as $n\to \infty$.

We say that two line segments in the plane {\em cross} each other if they have a point in common that is interior to both edges. Two line segments are {\em non-crossing} if they do not cross. Note that two non-crossing line segments may share an endpoint. A geometric graph is said to be {\em plane} if its edges do not cross, and {\em non-plane}, otherwise. A graph is {\em planar} if and only if it does not contain $K_5$ (the complete graph on 5 vertices) or $K_{3,3}$ (the complete bipartite graph on six vertices partitioned into two parts each of size $3$) as a minor. A {\em non-planar graph} is a graph which is not planar.

In order to test Theorems 1 and 4 from Biniaz et al. [1], we developed a computer program that serves as an algorithm utility kit for disk graphs. (An executable form of this program can be downloaded by clicking \href{https://github.com/evrenkaya/UnitDiskGraphvWITHOUTGRAPHVIEW}{here} (URL: $https://github.com/evrenkaya/UnitDiskGraphvWITHOUTGRAPHVIEW$) by clicking on ``UnitDiskGraph.jar'' and then ``View Raw'')

The following is a restatement of Theorems 1 and 4 from Biniaz et al. [1]:
\begin{customthm}{1}
\label{connected-k-thr}
Let $k\ge 2$ be an integer constant. Then, $n^{\frac{-k}{2k-2}}$ is a distance threshold function for $\dg$ to have a connected subgraph on $k$ points.
\end{customthm}

\begin{customthm}{4}
\label{plane-thr}
$n^{-\frac{2}{3}}$ is a threshold for $\dg$ to be plane.
\end{customthm}

In this paper, we explain some of the key implementation details of our program and then show our tests conducted for each theorem.

\section{Implementation Details}
In this section, we describe the implementations of the key Java classes within our program.

\subsection*{Vertex}
A vertex is a point in the unit square. Every vertex has x,y coordinates as doubles, a boolean variable to store visited state(used in Breadth First Search), and an adjacency list represented as an ArrayList\textless Vertex\textgreater.

\subsection*{Edge}
A straight-line edge. Every edge has references to its endpoints, a boolean variable to keep track of whether it is intersecting with another edge, and a weight as a double.

\subsection*{UnitDiskGraph}
A random disk graph. Stores all vertices as an ArrayList\textless Vertex\textgreater, all edges as an ArrayList\textless Edge\textgreater, and the current distance threshold as a double. The following methods in this class are now described in more detail:\\ \\
createNewRandomVertices() - creates a new set of vertices uniformly at random in the unit square\\ \\
createNewConnectedEdges() - compares the Euclidean distance between every pair of vertices(Pythagoras' Theorem) and if two vertices are at most the distance threshold apart, then a new edge is created with these two vertices as its endpoints\\ \\
determineIntersectingEdges() - checks every pair of edges to see if they intersect at a point other than any common endpoints. This is done using Java's Line2D.linesIntersect() method\\ \\
determineSuperFreeEdges() - checks every pair of free edges to see if there are any other vertices inside of the super free edge rectangular region

\subsection*{BreadthFirstSearch}
A class representing the Breadth First Search algorithm. Contains a reference to the UnitDiskGraph object that it will be performing its search on. This class also stores all the connected components as an ArrayList\textless ArrayList\textless Vertex\textgreater\textgreater, in other words, a list of lists of vertices. The two methods of importance here are as follows:\\ \\
getConnectedComponentWith(Vertex startingVertex) - starts breadth first search at the given vertex and returns the entire connected component containing this vertex as an ArrayList\textless Vertex\textgreater \\ \\
determineAllConnectedComponents() - calls the above method for each vertex in the graph, keeping track of which connected components have been found already


\section{Testing}
In this section, we explain how we tested Theorems 1 and 4 using our algorithm utility program.

In order to test Theorem 1, we chose different values of $n$ and $k$ to input and then recorded the number of connected components with at least $k$ points that appeared above, below and at the distance threshold function using a small value $\varepsilon$. Theorem 1 is verified if there is \textbf{at least one} connected component on $k$ points \textbf{above} the distance threshold, and, there are \textbf{no} connected components on $k$ points \textbf{below} the distance threshold. The following table shows our results for values of $n$ ranging from 50 - 10000.(Note: In this table, $a$ and $b$ are variables that replace $k$ and $2k-2$ respectively)

In order to test Theorem 4, we set $a=2$ and $b=3$ as constants and only varied $n$ and $\varepsilon$. For each value of $n$, we recorded the number of intersecting edges within the disk graph that appeared above, below and at the distance threshold using a small value $\varepsilon$. Theorem 4 is verified if there \textbf{exists} intersecting edges \textbf{above} the distance threshold, and, there are \textbf{no} intersecting edges \textbf{below} the distance threshold.

\section{Conclusion}
From Table 1, we see that for many combinations of $n$, $k$, and $\varepsilon$, there exists many connected components on $k$ points above the distance threshold
and none below the threshold, thus verifying Theorem 1. From Table 2, we see that for high values of $n$($\geq 1000$), there exists intersecting edges above the distance threshold and that there are no intersecting edges below the threshold. This verifies that $n^{-\frac{2}{3}}$ is a distance threshold for $\dg$ to be plane(i.e. Theorem 4).
